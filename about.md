Hi everyone, my name is Vy Hoa Phun and I am a Vietnamese student who is pursuing a Master degree in _Data Science_ at _University of Queensland_  ($$\text{UQ}$$) in Australia. <br><br>
Regarding my previous education background, I graduated with a Bachelor degree in _Computer Science_ at _Ho Chi Minh University of Technology_ ($$\text{HCMUT}$$) and my achievement during the time I studied here is nothing but a 2nd Prize at the Science Research Symposium 2018 held by the _Office for International Study Program_ ($$\text{OISP}$$). More precisely, my topic was _Developing Smart Traffic Light Control System_ in which many Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were applied to seek for the optimal signal timing such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Reinforcement Learning with Neural Networks approach, etc, but the scope of the project was only about an isolated signalized intersection. It is worth to mention that, I also used this topic to work on my thesis, more information about my thesis could be found <a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!AvsQDHFCYluCiAdjh65qNtTAMpOE?e=06IPWB"> here</a>.<br><br>
In the final year at $$\text{HCMUT}$$, I had a chance to learn a ML course, which covered many topics in probabilistic view, and luckily I am also a big fan of calculus, linear algebra, and probability & statistics. As a result, this combination attracts my biggest attention and it inspires me to learn as much as I could. That is why I decided to acquire a _Data Science_ degree to not only get a job which is relevant to my field of interest but also enrich my knowledge to make it more well-rounded.
